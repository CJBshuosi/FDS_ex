## 📋 TASK 1: Raft Consensus Algorithm

### What You Must Know

**The 3 States:**
```
FOLLOWER (default)
  ↓ (timeout 1s)
CANDIDATE (election)
  ↓ (majority votes)
LEADER (elected)
```

**The 3 Messages:**
- **Heartbeat** - Prove leader is alive
- **Candidacy** - Request votes
- **Vote** - Support candidate

**Key Numbers:**
- 1 second = follower timeout
- 0.5 seconds = leader heartbeat interval
- 2 seconds = vote collection time
- 5 seconds = election cooldown
- > 50% = majority needed

**The 5 Bugs:**
1. Race condition (buffer without locks)
2. Resigned = 0 (should be time.time())
3. Voted never reset (should reset on new election)
4. Last heartbeat initialized to current time
5. Missing thread synchronization

### Likely Questions

**Easy:**
- What are the 3 states?
- What are the 3 messages?
- What is the heartbeat timeout?

**Medium:**
- Explain the election process
- What is the purpose of voted flag?
- How does code determine if candidate won?

**Hard:**
- What happens if leader crashes?
- What is the race condition?
- Why is resigned = 0 a bug?

**Very Hard:**
- What are the limitations?
- How would you improve it?
- How would you add log replication?

## 📋 TASK 2: Causal Length Set (CLS)

### What You Must Know

**Counter-Based Membership:**
```
Odd counter  → Item IS in the set
Even counter → Item is NOT in the set
```

**The 4 Operations:**
- **add(item)** - Add item to set
- **remove(item)** - Remove item from set
- **contains(item)** - Check if item is in set
- **mutual_sync(other_carts)** - Synchronize replicas

**Key Concept:**
- mutual_sync takes MAXIMUM counter for each item
- This preserves all operations
- Ensures eventual consistency

**The Example:**
- Alice adds {Milk, Potato, Eggs}
- Bob adds {Sausage, Mustard, Coke, Potato}
- They sync
- Alice removes Sausage, adds Tofu, removes Potato
- They sync again
- **Final:** Bob's list does NOT contain Potato (counter is 2, even)

### Likely Questions

**Easy:**
- What is CLS?
- How does CLS represent membership?
- What are the 4 operations?

**Medium:**
- Explain the add() method
- Explain the remove() method
- What is the purpose of mutual_sync()?

**Hard:**
- What is the "causal" property?
- What is the time complexity?
- Is CLS suitable for distributed systems?

**Very Hard:**
- What are the limitations?
- How would you implement garbage collection?
- What is the relationship to CRDT?

## 🎤 Sample Interview

**Interviewer:** "Explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm"

**Good Answer:**
"Raft is a consensus algorithm for distributed systems. It has three main components:

First, there are three node states: Follower, Candidate, and Leader. Followers wait for heartbeats from the leader. If they don't receive a heartbeat for 1 second, they become candidates and start an election.

Second, there are three message types: Heartbeat (proves leader is alive), Candidacy (requests votes), and Vote (supports a candidate).

Third, the election process works like this: A candidate broadcasts a candidacy message, other nodes vote if they haven't voted yet, and if the candidate gets more than 50% of votes, it becomes the leader.

The key insight is that the leader sends heartbeats every 0.5 seconds to prevent new elections. If the leader crashes, followers timeout and start a new election."
