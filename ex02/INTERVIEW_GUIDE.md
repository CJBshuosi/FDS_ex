## 📋 TASK 1: Raft Consensus Algorithm

### What You Must Know

**The 3 States:**
- Follower (default, waits for heartbeat)
- Candidate (election, requests votes)
- Leader (elected, sends heartbeats)

**The 3 Messages:**
- Heartbeat (leader alive signal)
- Candidacy (vote request)
- Vote (support message)

**Key Numbers:**
- 1 second = follower timeout
- 0.5 seconds = leader heartbeat interval
- 2 seconds = vote collection time
- 5 seconds = election cooldown
- > 50% = majority needed

**The 5 Bugs:**
1. Race condition (buffer without locks)
2. Resigned initialized to 0 (should be time.time())
3. Voted never reset (should reset when starting new election)
4. Last heartbeat initialized to current time
5. Missing thread synchronization

### Likely Interview Questions

**Easy (1-2 min each):**
- What are the 3 states?
- What are the 3 messages?
- What is the heartbeat timeout?
- What is the purpose of heartbeat?

**Medium (2-3 min each):**
- Explain the election process step by step
- What is the purpose of the voted flag?
- What is the purpose of resigned variable?
- How does the code determine if candidate won?

**Hard (3-5 min each):**
- What happens if leader crashes?
- What is a race condition in the code?
- Why is resigned = 0 a bug?
- Why is voted never reset?

**Very Hard (5-10 min each):**
- What are the limitations of the implementation?
- How would you improve the election process?
- What happens with network partitions?
- How would you add log replication?

## 📋 TASK 2: Causal Length Set (CLS)

### What You Must Know

**Counter-Based Membership:**
- Odd counter = item IS in the set
- Even counter = item is NOT in the set

**The 4 Operations:**
- add(item) - Add item to set
- remove(item) - Remove item from set
- contains(item) - Check if item is in set
- mutual_sync(other_carts) - Synchronize with other replicas

**Key Concept:**
- mutual_sync takes MAXIMUM counter for each item
- This preserves all operations
- Ensures eventual consistency

**The Example:**
- Alice adds {Milk, Potato, Eggs}
- Bob adds {Sausage, Mustard, Coke, Potato}
- They sync
- Alice removes Sausage, adds Tofu, removes Potato
- They sync again
- Final: Bob's list does NOT contain Potato (counter is 2, even)

### Likely Interview Questions

**Easy (1-2 min each):**
- What is CLS?
- How does CLS represent membership?
- What are the 4 operations?
- What happens when you add an item already in the set?

**Medium (2-3 min each):**
- Explain the add() method
- Explain the remove() method
- What is the purpose of mutual_sync()?
- Trace through the example

**Hard (3-5 min each):**
- What is the "causal" property?
- What happens if you sync with multiple CLS?
- What is the time complexity?
- Is CLS suitable for distributed systems?

**Very Hard (5-10 min each):**
- What are the limitations of CLS?
- How would you implement garbage collection?
- How would you extend CLS for ordered operations?
- What is the relationship between CLS and CRDT?

## 🎯 Interview Strategy

### Before Interview
1. **Review the cheatsheet** (10 minutes)
2. **Read the questions** (15 minutes)
3. **Read the answers** (20 minutes)

## 🎤 Sample Interview

**Interviewer:** "Can you explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm?"

**Good Answer:**
"Raft is a consensus algorithm for distributed systems. It has three main components:

First, there are three node states: Follower, Candidate, and Leader. Followers wait for heartbeats from the leader. If they don't receive a heartbeat for 1 second, they become candidates and start an election.

Second, there are three message types: Heartbeat (proves leader is alive), Candidacy (requests votes), and Vote (supports a candidate).

Third, the election process works like this: A candidate broadcasts a candidacy message, other nodes vote if they haven't voted yet, and if the candidate gets more than 50% of votes, it becomes the leader.

The key insight is that the leader sends heartbeats every 0.5 seconds to prevent new elections. If the leader crashes, followers timeout and start a new election."

**Why this is good:**
- Explains the main concepts
- Uses examples
- Shows understanding
- Organized and clear

### Task 2 (CLS):
✅ Odd counter = in set, Even counter = not in set
✅ 4 operations: add, remove, contains, mutual_sync
✅ mutual_sync takes maximum counter
