üéØ THE CORE CONCEPT (2 Minutes to Understand)
================================================================================

WHAT IS RAFT?
  A system where multiple computers (nodes) elect a leader

WHY?
  Distributed systems need to agree on who makes decisions

HOW?
  1. Nodes start as FOLLOWERS (waiting for leader)
  2. If leader disappears ‚Üí become CANDIDATES (ask for votes)
  3. Get majority votes ‚Üí become LEADER (send heartbeats)
  4. If leader crashes ‚Üí repeat

================================================================================
üß† THE 3 THINGS YOU MUST MEMORIZE
================================================================================

1. THE 3 STATES
   FOLLOWER ‚Üí (1s timeout) ‚Üí CANDIDATE ‚Üí (majority votes) ‚Üí LEADER
                                  ‚Üì
                             (lose) + 5s cooldown
                                  ‚Üì
                              FOLLOWER

2. THE 3 MESSAGES
   HEARTBEAT  = "I'm alive" (leader ‚Üí all)
   CANDIDACY  = "Vote for me" (candidate ‚Üí all)
   VOTE       = "I support you" (voter ‚Üí candidate)

3. THE KEY NUMBERS
   1 second   = heartbeat timeout
   0.5 second = leader sends heartbeat
   2 seconds  = candidate waits for votes
   5 seconds  = election cooldown
   > 50%      = majority needed to win

üé§ YOUR OPENING STATEMENT (Memorize This!)
================================================================================

"Hello everyone. Today I'm going to explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm.

Imagine you have multiple computers that need to work together and agree on 
a leader. This code shows how they do it.

The main idea is: one leader, many followers. The leader makes decisions, 
and followers follow the leader's instructions."

üí° PRO TIPS
================================================================================

1. Read out loud - Don't just read silently
2. Use the diagrams - Point to them during presentation
3. Tell a story - Make it interesting, not boring
4. Use examples - The 3-node scenario is your best friend
5. Speak slowly - Give yourself time to think
6. Pause between sections - Let information sink in
7. Make eye contact - Connect with your audience
8. Breathe - Don't rush
9. Smile - You know this material!
10. Have fun - This is actually cool stuff!

================================================================================
üÜò EMERGENCY BACKUP (2-Sentence Version)
================================================================================

"This code implements leader election. Nodes start as followers. If the 
leader disappears, they become candidates and vote for a new leader. The 
winner sends heartbeats to prove it's alive. If it crashes, the process 
repeats."

================================================================================
üìû COMMON QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: Why do we need Raft?
A: Distributed systems need to agree on a leader.

Q: What happens if the leader crashes?
A: Followers timeout and start a new election.

Q: Why 1 second timeout?
A: Balance between detecting crashes and avoiding too many elections.

Q: Why majority voting?
A: Ensures only one leader is elected.

Q: What if two nodes become candidates?
A: They both ask for votes. The one with majority wins.
