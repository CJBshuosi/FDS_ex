## 🎯 The 3 Most Important Things

### 1. The 3 States
```
FOLLOWER → (1s timeout) → CANDIDATE → (majority votes) → LEADER
```

### 2. The 3 Messages
- **HEARTBEAT**: "I'm alive"
- **CANDIDACY**: "Vote for me"
- **VOTE**: "I support you"

### 3. The Key Numbers
- 1 second = heartbeat timeout
- 0.5 seconds = leader heartbeat interval
- 2 seconds = vote collection time
- 5 seconds = election cooldown
- > 50% = majority needed

## 🎤 Your Opening Statement

**Memorize this:**

"Hello everyone. Today I'm going to explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm.

Imagine you have multiple computers that need to work together and agree on a leader. This code shows how they do it.

The main idea is: one leader, many followers. The leader makes decisions, and followers follow the leader's instructions."

## 📊 Presentation Structure (7-8 minutes)

| Section | Time | Content |
|---------|------|---------|
| Introduction | 30s | What is Raft? Why do we need it? |
| Part 1 | 1 min | Three states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) |
| Part 2 | 1 min | Three messages (Heartbeat, Candidacy, Vote) |
| Part 3 | 2 min | Example scenario (3-node election) |
| Part 4 | 1 min | Key concepts (Majority, Timeout, Cooldown) |
| Part 5 | 30s | Why is this important? Real-world uses |
| Conclusion | 30s | Summary and thank you |

## 🔄 Code Execution Flow (Simple Version)

```
1. main() starts
   ↓
2. initialize(3) creates 3 nodes
   ↓
3. Each node starts a thread
   ↓
4. Each thread runs node.run() (main loop)
   ↓
5. Main loop:
   - Process messages from buffer
   - Check for follower timeout
   - Handle candidate state
   - Handle leader state
   - Sleep 0.1 seconds
   - Loop back to step 5
   ↓
6. When messages arrive:
   - deliver() processes them
   - broadcast() sends responses
   - count_active_nodes() checks majority
```

## 💡 Key Functions

| Function | Purpose | Called By |

| initialize() | Create nodes | main() |
| run() | Main loop | Thread |
| deliver() | Process messages | run() |
| broadcast() | Send messages | run(), deliver() |
| count_active_nodes() | Count active nodes | run(), deliver() |
| crash() | Simulate failure | User |
| recover() | Restart node | User |

## 🆘 Emergency Backup (2-Sentence Version)

If you forget everything, remember this:

**"This code implements leader election. Nodes start as followers. If the leader disappears, they become candidates and vote for a new leader. The winner sends heartbeats to prove it's alive. If it crashes, the process repeats."**

---

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why do we need Raft?**
A: Distributed systems need to agree on a leader.

**Q: What happens if the leader crashes?**
A: Followers timeout and start a new election.

**Q: Why 1 second timeout?**
A: Balance between detecting crashes and avoiding too many elections.

**Q: Why majority voting?**
A: Ensures only one leader is elected.

**Q: What if two nodes become candidates?**
A: They both ask for votes. The one with majority wins.
