|---------|------|---------|
| Introduction | 30s | What is Raft? Why do we need it? |
| Part 1 | 1 min | Three states (Follower, Candidate, Leader) |
| Part 2 | 1 min | Three messages (Heartbeat, Candidacy, Vote) |
| Part 3 | 2 min | Example scenario (3-node election) |

## 🧠 What You MUST Know

### The 3 States
```
FOLLOWER (default)
  ↓ (no heartbeat for 1s)
CANDIDATE (asks for votes)
  ↓ (gets majority)
LEADER (sends heartbeats)
  ↓ (loses election)
FOLLOWER (+ 5s cooldown)
```

### The 3 Messages
- **HEARTBEAT**: "I'm alive" (leader → all)
- **CANDIDACY**: "Vote for me" (candidate → all)
- **VOTE**: "I support you" (voter → candidate)

### The Key Numbers
- **1 second** = heartbeat timeout
- **0.5 seconds** = leader heartbeat interval
- **2 seconds** = vote collection time
- **5 seconds** = election cooldown
- **> 50%** = majority needed

### The Opening
"Hello everyone. Today I'm going to explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm. Imagine you have multiple computers that need to work together and agree on a leader. This code shows how they do it. The main idea is: one leader, many followers."

## 💡 Key Insight

Think of it like a **classroom election**:

1. **Start**: Everyone is a student (follower)
2. **Teacher disappears**: Students wait 1 second
3. **Candidate**: A student says "I'll be the new leader"
4. **Voting**: Other students vote for the candidate
5. **Winner**: Student with most votes becomes leader
6. **Proof**: New leader says "I'm here" every 0.5 seconds
7. **Crash**: If leader disappears, repeat from step 2

## 🎯 Presentation Tips

1. **Speak clearly and slowly** - Don't rush
2. **Make eye contact** - Connect with audience
3. **Use hand gestures** - Make it visual
4. **Pause between sections** - Let information sink in
5. **Tell a story** - Make it interesting
6. **Use examples** - The 3-node scenario is key
7. **Refer to visuals** - Use the mind map and diagrams
8. **Breathe** - Don't hold your breath
9. **Smile** - You know this material!
10. **Have fun** - This is actually cool stuff!

## 🆘 If You Forget

### Super Short Version (2 sentences)
"This code implements leader election. Nodes start as followers. If the leader disappears, they become candidates and vote for a new leader. The winner sends heartbeats to prove it's alive. If it crashes, the process repeats."

### If you forget the states:
"Followers wait for heartbeat. Candidates ask for votes. Leaders send heartbeats."

### If you forget the messages:
"Heartbeat from leader, candidacy from candidate, vote from voters."

### If you forget the timeline:
"1 second timeout, become candidate, ask for votes, majority wins, send heartbeats."

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why do we need Raft?**
A: Distributed systems need to agree on a leader.

**Q: What happens if the leader crashes?**
A: Followers timeout and start a new election.

**Q: Why 1 second timeout?**
A: Balance between detecting crashes and avoiding too many elections.

**Q: Why majority voting?**
A: Ensures only one leader is elected.

**Q: What if two nodes become candidates?**
A: They both ask for votes. The one with majority wins.

## 💪 You've Got This!

You have all the materials you need. The algorithm is actually quite simple:
- Nodes start as followers
- They wait for heartbeat
- If no heartbeat, they become candidates
- They ask for votes
- The one with majority becomes leader
