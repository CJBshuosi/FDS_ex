## 🎯 The Core Concept (2 minutes to understand)

**What is Raft?**
A system where multiple computers (nodes) elect a leader.

**Why?**
Distributed systems need to agree on who makes decisions.

**How?**
1. Nodes start as **followers** (waiting for leader)
2. If leader disappears → become **candidates** (ask for votes)
3. Get majority votes → become **leader** (send heartbeats)
4. If leader crashes → repeat

**That's it!** Everything else is just details.

---

## 📚 The 3 Things You MUST Memorize

### 1️⃣ The 3 States
```
FOLLOWER → (1s timeout) → CANDIDATE → (majority votes) → LEADER
                              ↓
                         (lose) + 5s cooldown
```

### 2️⃣ The 3 Messages
| Message | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| HEARTBEAT | "I'm alive" (leader → all) |
| CANDIDACY | "Vote for me" (candidate → all) |
| VOTE | "I support you" (voter → candidate) |

### 3️⃣ The Key Numbers
- **1 second** = heartbeat timeout
- **0.5 seconds** = leader sends heartbeat
- **2 seconds** = candidate waits for votes
- **5 seconds** = election cooldown
- **> 50%** = majority needed to win

---

## 🎤 Your Opening Statement (Memorize this!)

**"Hello everyone. Today I'm going to explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm.**

**Imagine you have multiple computers that need to work together and agree on a leader. This code shows how they do it.**

**The main idea is: one leader, many followers. The leader makes decisions, and followers follow the leader's instructions."**

## 🆘 Emergency Backup

If you forget everything, remember this **2-sentence version**:

**"This code implements leader election. Nodes start as followers. If the leader disappears, they become candidates and vote for a new leader. The winner sends heartbeats to prove it's alive. If it crashes, the process repeats."**

---

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Why do we need Raft?**
A: Distributed systems need to agree on a leader.

**Q: What happens if the leader crashes?**
A: Followers timeout and start a new election.

**Q: Why 1 second timeout?**
A: Balance between detecting crashes and avoiding too many elections.

**Q: Why majority voting?**
A: Ensures only one leader is elected.

**Q: What if two nodes become candidates?**
A: They both ask for votes. The one with majority wins.
