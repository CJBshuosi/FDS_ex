## 🧠 What You MUST Memorize

### The 3 States (CRITICAL)
```
FOLLOWER → (1s timeout) → CANDIDATE → (majority votes) → LEADER
                              ↓
                         (lose) + 5s cooldown
                              ↓
                          FOLLOWER
```

### The 3 Messages (CRITICAL)
- **HEARTBEAT**: "I'm alive" (sent by leader every 0.5s)
- **CANDIDACY**: "Vote for me" (sent by candidate)
- **VOTE**: "I support you" (sent by voter)

### The Key Numbers (CRITICAL)
- **1 second** = heartbeat timeout
- **0.5 seconds** = leader sends heartbeat
- **2 seconds** = candidate waits for votes
- **5 seconds** = election cooldown
- **> 50%** = majority needed to win

### The Opening (CRITICAL)
"Hello everyone. Today I'm going to explain the Raft Consensus Algorithm. Imagine you have multiple computers that need to work together and agree on a leader. This code shows how they do it. The main idea is: one leader, many followers."

## 💡 Understanding Tips

### Think of it like a classroom election:
- **Follower** = Student waiting for teacher
- **Candidate** = Student running for class president
- **Leader** = Class president
- **Heartbeat** = Teacher saying "I'm here"
- **Candidacy** = "Vote for me for president"
- **Vote** = "I vote for you"

### Think of the timeline:
1. Everyone waits for the teacher
2. Teacher disappears (crash)
3. Students wait 1 second
4. A student says "I'll be the new leader"
5. Other students vote
6. Winner becomes new leader
7. New leader says "I'm here" every 0.5 seconds

## 🆘 If You Forget Something

### If you forget the 3 states:
"Nodes can be followers, candidates, or leaders. Followers wait for heartbeat. Candidates ask for votes. Leaders send heartbeats."

### If you forget the 3 messages:
"There are three types of messages: heartbeat from leader, candidacy from candidate, and vote from voters."

### If you forget the timeline:
"Nodes start as followers. After 1 second with no heartbeat, they become candidates. They ask for votes. The one with majority votes becomes leader. Leader sends heartbeats every 0.5 seconds."

### If you forget the key numbers:
"1 second timeout, 0.5 second heartbeat, 2 seconds to collect votes, 5 seconds cooldown."

## 🎓 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why do we need Raft?**
A: "Distributed systems need to agree on a leader. Raft is a simple way to do that."

**Q: What happens if the leader crashes?**
A: "Followers don't receive heartbeats, so they become candidates and start a new election."

**Q: What if two nodes become candidates at the same time?**
A: "They both ask for votes. The one that gets majority first becomes leader."

**Q: Why 1 second timeout?**
A: "It's a balance between detecting crashes quickly and avoiding too many elections."

**Q: Why majority voting?**
A: "It ensures only one leader is elected. Two different leaders can't both get majority."

**Q: What if a node crashes during election?**
A: "It doesn't matter. We only count votes from active nodes."

**Q: How does the system recover from a crash?**
A: "When the crashed node recovers, it becomes a follower and receives heartbeats from the leader."
