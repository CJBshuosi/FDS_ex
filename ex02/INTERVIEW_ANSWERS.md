# 📝 Interview Answers - Task 1 & Task 2

## 🎯 TASK 1: Raft Consensus Algorithm - Answers

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**Q1.1: What is the main purpose of Raft?**

**Answer:**
The Raft Consensus Algorithm is designed to elect a leader in a distributed system where multiple nodes need to agree on a single leader. The main purpose is to ensure that:
1. Exactly one leader is elected at a time
2. All nodes eventually agree on who the leader is
3. If the leader crashes, a new leader is elected automatically

**Why we need a leader:**
- Centralized decision-making
- Prevents conflicting decisions
- Simplifies coordination
- Ensures consistency

---

**Q1.2: What are the three states?**

**Answer:**
1. **Follower** (default state)
   - Waits for heartbeat from leader
   - Votes when receiving candidacy message
   - Becomes candidate if heartbeat times out

2. **Candidate** (election state)
   - Requests votes from other nodes
   - Waits for majority votes
   - Becomes leader if wins election
   - Becomes follower if receives heartbeat from leader

3. **Leader** (elected state)
   - Sends heartbeat every 0.5 seconds
   - Proves it's alive
   - Prevents new elections

---

**Q1.3: What are the three message types?**

**Answer:**
1. **Heartbeat** - "I'm alive"
   - Sent by leader every 0.5 seconds
   - Proves leader is alive
   - Prevents new elections

2. **Candidacy** - "Vote for me"
   - Sent by candidate when starting election
   - Requests votes from other nodes
   - Triggers voting process

3. **Vote** - "I support you"
   - Sent by follower when receiving candidacy
   - Supports a candidate
   - Counted by all nodes to determine leader

---

**Q1.4: What is the purpose of heartbeat?**

**Answer:**
The heartbeat message serves two purposes:
1. **Proves the leader is alive** - If followers receive heartbeat, they know leader is working
2. **Prevents new elections** - Resets the 1-second timeout counter

**Frequency:** Every 0.5 seconds (line 65-66)

---

**Q1.5: What happens when follower doesn't receive heartbeat for 1 second?**

**Answer:**
1. The follower's timeout triggers (line 39)
2. It becomes a candidate (line 44)
3. It waits 1-3 seconds (line 54)
4. It broadcasts candidacy message (line 62)
5. Other nodes vote for it
6. If it gets majority votes, it becomes leader

**Why 1 second?**
- Balance between detecting crashes quickly and avoiding too many false elections
- If too short: many unnecessary elections
- If too long: slow to detect leader crash

---

### Level 2: Implementation Details

**Q2.1: Explain the election process step by step**

**Answer:**
```
Step 1: Follower times out
  - No heartbeat for 1 second
  - Becomes candidate (line 44)

Step 2: Candidate starts election
  - Waits 1-3 seconds (line 54)
  - Broadcasts candidacy message (line 62)

Step 3: Other nodes vote
  - Receive candidacy message
  - If haven't voted yet, send vote (line 96-97)
  - Mark voted = True

Step 4: Candidate counts votes
  - Receives vote messages
  - Increments vote counter (line 102-104)

Step 5: Check for majority
  - If votes > count_active_nodes() // 2 (line 49)
  - Becomes leader (line 50)

Step 6: Leader sends heartbeat
  - Broadcasts heartbeat (line 52)
  - Other nodes receive it and become followers
```

**What if two candidates start elections?**
- Both broadcast candidacy
- Followers vote for the first one they receive
- One gets majority, becomes leader
- Other becomes follower when receiving heartbeat

---

**Q2.2: What is the purpose of `voted` flag?**

**Answer:**
The `voted` flag prevents a node from voting twice in the same election.

**How it works:**
- Initially: `voted = False` (line 19)
- When voting: `voted = True` (line 97)
- When receiving heartbeat: `voted` is NOT reset (BUG!)

**Bug:** The `voted` flag is never reset, so a node can only vote once in its entire lifetime!

**Fix:** Reset `voted = False` when starting new election (line 42)

---

**Q2.3: What is the purpose of `resigned` variable?**

**Answer:**
The `resigned` variable implements a 5-second cooldown to prevent a node from immediately becoming a candidate again.

**How it works:**
- Initially: `resigned = 0` (line 17) - BUG!
- When losing election: `resigned = time.time()` (line 58)
- Check: `time.time() - self.resigned > 5` (line 40)

**Why necessary:**
- Prevents rapid re-elections
- Gives new leader time to stabilize
- Reduces network traffic

**Bug:** Initialized to 0 instead of `time.time()`, so condition is always true at startup!

---

**Q2.4: How does code determine if candidate won?**

**Answer:**
```python
if self.votes[self.id] > self.count_active_nodes() // 2:
    self.state = 'leader'
```

**Explanation:**
- `self.votes[self.id]` = number of votes received
- `self.count_active_nodes() // 2` = half of active nodes
- `//` = integer division (rounds down)
- Example: 3 nodes → need > 1 vote (i.e., 2 votes)

**Why majority?**
- Ensures only one leader is elected
- Prevents split-brain scenarios

---

**Q2.5: What is the purpose of `buffer` dictionary?**

**Answer:**
The `buffer` dictionary stores messages for each node asynchronously.

**Structure:**
```python
buffer = {
    0: [(msg_type, value), ...],
    1: [(msg_type, value), ...],
    2: [(msg_type, value), ...],
}
```

**Why use buffer instead of direct messages?**
- Asynchronous communication (non-blocking)
- Simulates network delay
- Prevents race conditions (somewhat)
- Allows nodes to process messages at their own pace

---

**Q2.6: Explain the deliver() method**

**Answer:**

**For Heartbeat:**
```python
self.last_heartbeat = time.time()  # Reset timeout
if self.state == 'candidate' or self.leader == None:
    self.state = 'follower'  # Become follower
    self.leader = value  # Update leader
```
- Updates last heartbeat time
- If candidate, becomes follower (leader won)
- If no leader known, sets leader

**For Candidacy:**
```python
if not self.voted:
    self.broadcast('vote', (self.id, value))
    self.voted = True
```
- If haven't voted yet, vote for candidate
- Mark as voted

**For Vote:**
```python
if candidate_id in self.votes:
    self.votes[candidate_id] += 1
else:
    self.votes[candidate_id] = 1
if self.votes[candidate_id] > self.count_active_nodes() // 2:
    self.leader = candidate_id
```
- Count the vote
- If majority reached, set leader

---

### Level 3: Advanced & Edge Cases

**Q3.1: What happens if leader crashes?**

**Answer:**
```
1. Leader crashes
   ↓
2. Followers don't receive heartbeat
   ↓
3. After 1 second, followers timeout
   ↓
4. Followers become candidates
   ↓
5. Candidates start elections
   ↓
6. One candidate gets majority votes
   ↓
7. New leader is elected
   ↓
8. New leader sends heartbeat
   ↓
9. System is stable again
```

**Time to elect new leader:** ~1-5 seconds
- 1 second for timeout
- 1-3 seconds for random wait
- 2 seconds for vote collection

---

**Q3.2: What is a race condition in the code?**

**Answer:**
The `buffer` dictionary is accessed without locks in a multithreaded environment.

**Race condition:**
```python
# Thread 1
buffer[node.id].append((msg_type, value))  # Line 72

# Thread 2
msg_type, value = buffer[self.id].pop(0)   # Line 35
```

**What could go wrong:**
- One thread appends while another pops
- Data corruption
- Messages lost
- Program crash

**Fix:**
```python
import threading
buffer_lock = threading.Lock()

# When accessing buffer:
with buffer_lock:
    buffer[node.id].append((msg_type, value))
```

---

**Q3.3: Why is `self.resigned = 0` a bug?**

**Answer:**
```python
self.resigned = 0  # Line 17 - BUG!

# Later:
if time.time() - self.resigned > 5:  # Line 40
```

**Problem:**
- `time.time()` returns current time (e.g., 1697000000)
- `time.time() - 0` = 1697000000 (huge number!)
- Condition is always True at startup

**Consequence:**
- Node can become candidate immediately
- 5-second cooldown doesn't work

**Fix:**
```python
self.resigned = time.time()  # Initialize to current time
```

---

**Q3.4: Why is `voted` flag never reset?**

**Answer:**
The `voted` flag is set to True (line 97) but never reset to False.

**Consequence:**
- Node can only vote once in its entire lifetime
- After first election, node can never vote again
- Subsequent elections fail

**Where it should be reset:**
```python
# Line 42 - when starting new election
self.voted = False
```

---

**Q3.5: What if node receives heartbeat from different leader?**

**Answer:**
```python
if self.state == 'candidate' or self.leader == None:
    self.state = 'follower'
    self.leader = value  # Update to new leader
```

**Current behavior:**
- Updates to new leader
- Becomes follower

**Is this correct?**
- Partially - it allows leader changes
- But it doesn't validate if new leader is legitimate
- Could cause issues if multiple leaders claim authority

---

**Q3.6: Difference between two ways of determining leader**

**Answer:**

**Way 1: Each node counts votes**
```python
if self.votes[candidate_id] > self.count_active_nodes() // 2 and self.leader == None:
    self.leader = candidate_id
```
- Any node can detect leader
- More robust (doesn't depend on candidate)
- Used in current code

**Way 2: Only candidate counts votes**
```python
if self.votes[candidate_id] > self.count_active_nodes() // 2 and self.leader == None and self.state == 'candidate':
    self.leader = candidate_id
```
- Only candidate announces itself
- Candidate must send heartbeat to inform others
- More centralized

**Which is better?**
- Way 1 is more robust (doesn't depend on candidate's heartbeat)
- Way 2 is more explicit (candidate announces itself)

---

**Q3.7: Purpose of `time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))`**

**Answer:**
This prevents multiple candidates from starting elections at exactly the same time.

**Why important:**
- If all candidates start at same time, they all broadcast candidacy
- Followers vote for first one they receive
- Could lead to split votes
- Random delay ensures staggered starts

**Example:**
- Candidate 0: waits 1.2 seconds
- Candidate 1: waits 2.5 seconds
- Candidate 0 starts first, gets votes first

---

**Q3.8: Why check `if self.state == 'candidate'` after sleep?**

**Answer:**
Because the node might have received a heartbeat or candidacy message during the sleep and changed state.

**Scenario:**
```
1. Node becomes candidate
2. Starts sleep(random 1-3 seconds)
3. During sleep, receives heartbeat from leader
4. Becomes follower
5. After sleep, checks: if self.state == 'candidate'
6. Condition is False, doesn't start election
```

**If didn't check:**
- Node would start election even though it's now a follower
- Causes unnecessary elections

---

**Q3.9: What is the threading model?**

**Answer:**
Each node runs in a daemon thread.

**How it works:**
```python
threading.Thread(target=self.run, daemon=True).start()
```

**What is daemon=True?**
- Daemon threads are background threads
- When main thread exits, daemon threads are killed
- Doesn't wait for daemon threads to finish

**Consequence:**
- When main program exits, all nodes stop immediately
- No graceful shutdown

---

**Q3.10: How to handle node crash and recovery?**

**Answer:**
Current implementation:
```python
def crash(self):
    self.working = False
    self.state = 'crashed'
    buffer[self.id] = []

def recover(self):
    buffer[self.id] = []
    self.state = 'follower'
    self.working = True
```

**What's preserved:**
- Node ID
- Thread (still running)

**What's reset:**
- State → follower
- Buffer → empty
- Working → True

**What should be preserved:**
- Nothing (clean slate is good)

**What could be improved:**
- Preserve some state (e.g., term number in real Raft)
- Graceful shutdown instead of immediate crash

---

## 🎯 TASK 2: Causal Length Set - Answers

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**Q2.1: What is CLS?**

**Answer:**
A Causal Length Set (CLS) is a data structure that represents a set where items can be added and removed, and the state can be synchronized across multiple replicas without conflicts.

**Key features:**
- Handles concurrent operations
- Supports eventual consistency
- No central authority needed
- Automatically resolves conflicts

---

**Q2.2: How does CLS represent set membership?**

**Answer:**
Using a counter for each item:
- **Odd counter** → item is in the set
- **Even counter** → item is not in the set

**Example:**
```
Item: 'Milk'
Counter: 1 (odd) → Milk is in the set
Counter: 2 (even) → Milk is not in the set
Counter: 3 (odd) → Milk is in the set again
```

**Why use counter instead of boolean?**
- Tracks history of operations
- Handles concurrent add/remove
- Enables conflict resolution

---

**Q2.3: What are the four main operations?**

**Answer:**
1. **add(item)** - Add item to set
2. **remove(item)** - Remove item from set
3. **contains(item)** - Check if item is in set
4. **mutual_sync(other_carts)** - Synchronize with other replicas

---

**Q2.4: What happens when you add an item already in the set?**

**Answer:**
```python
def add(self, item):
    if item not in self.cart:
        self.cart[item] = 1
    elif self.cart[item] % 2 == 0:  # Only if even
        self.cart[item] += 1
```

**If item already in set (odd counter):**
- Condition `self.cart[item] % 2 == 0` is False
- Nothing happens
- Item stays in set

**If you add multiple times:**
- First add: counter = 1 (in set)
- Second add: nothing (counter is odd)
- Third add: nothing (counter is odd)

---

**Q2.5: What happens when you remove an item not in the set?**

**Answer:**
```python
def remove(self, item):
    if item in self.cart and self.cart[item] % 2 == 1:
        self.cart[item] += 1
```

**If item not in set (even counter or doesn't exist):**
- Condition is False
- Nothing happens
- Item stays not in set

---

### Level 2: Implementation Details

**Q2.6: Explain add() method**

**Answer:**
```python
def add(self, item):
    if item not in self.cart:
        self.cart[item] = 1  # New item, counter = 1 (odd, in set)
    elif self.cart[item] % 2 == 0:  # If counter is even
        self.cart[item] += 1  # Increment to make it odd
```

**Logic:**
- If item doesn't exist: create with counter 1 (odd = in set)
- If item exists with even counter: increment to make it odd
- If item exists with odd counter: do nothing

**Why check `% 2 == 0`?**
- To check if counter is even
- Only increment if even (to make it odd)

---

**Q2.7: Explain remove() method**

**Answer:**
```python
def remove(self, item):
    if item in self.cart and self.cart[item] % 2 == 1:
        self.cart[item] += 1
```

**Logic:**
- If item exists AND counter is odd: increment to make it even
- Otherwise: do nothing

**Why check `% 2 == 1`?**
- To check if counter is odd (item in set)
- Only increment if odd (to make it even)

---

**Q2.8: What is mutual_sync()?**

**Answer:**
```python
def mutual_sync(self, other_carts):
    mutual_cart = self.cart.copy()
    for other in other_carts:
        for item, counter in other.cart.items():
            if item in mutual_cart:
                mutual_cart[item] = max(mutual_cart[item], counter)
            else:
                mutual_cart[item] = counter
    
    self.cart = mutual_cart
    for other in other_carts:
        other.cart = mutual_cart
```

**What it does:**
1. Copy current cart
2. For each other replica:
   - For each item in other replica:
     - Take maximum counter
3. Update all replicas with merged cart

**Why use maximum?**
- Ensures all operations are preserved
- If one replica has counter 3, other has counter 2
- Result is 3 (preserves all operations)

---

**Q2.9: Trace through the example**

**Answer:**

**Initial state:**
```
Alice: {}
Bob: {}
```

**Step 1: Alice adds items**
```
Alice: {Milk:1, Potato:1, Eggs:1}
Bob: {}
```

**Step 2: Bob adds items**
```
Alice: {Milk:1, Potato:1, Eggs:1}
Bob: {Sausage:1, Mustard:1, Coke:1, Potato:1}
```

**Step 3: Bob syncs with Alice**
```
Both: {Milk:1, Potato:1, Eggs:1, Sausage:1, Mustard:1, Coke:1}
```

**Step 4: Alice removes and adds**
```
Alice: {Milk:1, Tofu:1, Eggs:1, Sausage:1, Mustard:1, Coke:1, Potato:2}
Bob: {Milk:1, Potato:1, Eggs:1, Sausage:1, Mustard:1, Coke:1}
```

**Step 5: Alice syncs with Bob**
```
Both: {Milk:1, Tofu:1, Eggs:1, Sausage:1, Mustard:1, Coke:1, Potato:2}
```

**Final answer:**
- Bob's list contains: Milk, Tofu, Eggs, Sausage, Mustard, Coke
- Bob's list does NOT contain: Potato (counter is 2, even)

---

**Q2.10: Difference between copy() and assignment**

**Answer:**
```python
mutual_cart = self.cart.copy()  # Shallow copy
mutual_cart = self.cart         # Reference
```

**Shallow copy:**
- Creates new dictionary object
- Changes to copy don't affect original
- But if values are mutable, they're shared

**Reference:**
- Points to same dictionary
- Changes affect both

**Is shallow copy sufficient?**
- Yes, because values are integers (immutable)
- If values were lists, would need deep copy

---

### Level 3: Advanced & Edge Cases

**Q3.1: What is the "causal" property?**

**Answer:**
The "causal" property means operations respect causality - if operation A happens before operation B, the result reflects this ordering.

**Example:**
```
Alice: add(Milk) → remove(Milk)
Bob: doesn't know about these operations

After sync:
Bob knows: Milk was added then removed
Result: Milk is not in Bob's set
```

**How counter ensures causality:**
- Counter tracks number of operations
- Higher counter = more recent state
- Taking maximum preserves all operations

---

**Q3.2: What if you sync with multiple CLS at same time?**

**Answer:**
The method takes maximum counter for each item across all instances.

**Example:**
```
Alice: {Milk:1, Potato:3}
Bob: {Milk:2, Eggs:1}
Charlie: {Milk:1, Potato:2}

After sync:
All: {Milk:2, Potato:3, Eggs:1}
```

**Is order important?**
- No, because we take maximum
- Result is same regardless of order

---

**Q3.3: Can replicas have different states after syncing?**

**Answer:**
No, after `mutual_sync()`, all replicas have identical state.

**But:**
- If new operations happen after sync, states diverge
- Need to sync again to converge

---

**Q3.4: Time complexity of mutual_sync()**

**Answer:**
O(n * m) where:
- n = number of other CLS instances
- m = number of items in each instance

**Breakdown:**
```
for other in other_carts:           # O(n)
    for item, counter in other.cart.items():  # O(m)
        # O(1) operations
```

**Can you optimize?**
- Use vector clocks instead of counters
- Use delta-based sync (only sync changes)
- Use bloom filters for membership

---

**Q3.5: What if you add/remove same item multiple times?**

**Answer:**
Counter keeps incrementing.

**Example:**
```
add(Milk) → counter = 1 (in set)
remove(Milk) → counter = 2 (not in set)
add(Milk) → counter = 3 (in set)
remove(Milk) → counter = 4 (not in set)
```

**What if counter overflows?**
- In Python, integers don't overflow
- In other languages, could be a problem
- Solution: garbage collection or reset

---

**Q3.6: Is CLS suitable for distributed systems with partitions?**

**Answer:**
Yes, CLS is designed for eventual consistency.

**Scenario: Network partition**
```
Partition 1: Alice adds Milk
Partition 2: Bob removes Milk

After partition heals:
Both sync
Result: Milk counter = max(1, 2) = 2 (not in set)
```

**Why it works:**
- No central authority
- Each replica can operate independently
- Sync resolves conflicts automatically

---

**Q3.7: Difference between CLS and traditional set**

**Answer:**

**Traditional Set:**
- Can't handle concurrent operations
- Requires locks or central authority
- Conflicts cause errors

**CLS:**
- Handles concurrent operations
- No locks needed
- Conflicts resolved automatically

**Trade-off:**
- CLS uses more memory (counters instead of booleans)
- CLS has eventual consistency (not immediate)
- CLS is more scalable

---

**Q3.8: Can you implement CLS with different data structure?**

**Answer:**
Yes, you could use:
- List: `[(item, counter), ...]`
- Set: `{(item, counter), ...}`
- Custom class: `Item(name, counter)`

**Advantages of dictionary:**
- O(1) lookup
- Easy to update
- Natural representation

**Advantages of list:**
- Ordered
- Can iterate easily

---

### Level 4: Design & Optimization

**Q4.1: Limitations of CLS**

**Answer:**
1. **Counter overflow** - Counters keep growing
2. **No garbage collection** - Old counters never cleaned
3. **No ordering** - Can't determine order of operations
4. **Memory overhead** - Stores all items ever added
5. **No other operations** - No union, intersection, etc.

---

**Q4.2: How to implement garbage collection?**

**Answer:**
```python
def garbage_collect(self):
    # Reset all counters to 0 or 1
    for item in self.cart:
        if self.cart[item] % 2 == 1:  # If in set
            self.cart[item] = 1
        else:  # If not in set
            self.cart[item] = 0
```

**Challenges:**
- Must coordinate across replicas
- Can't lose information about operations
- Need consensus on when to collect

---

**Q4.3: How to extend CLS for ordered operations?**

**Answer:**
Add timestamps or vector clocks:

```python
class CLS_Ordered:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cart = {}  # {item: (counter, timestamp)}
    
    def add(self, item):
        if item not in self.cart:
            self.cart[item] = (1, time.time())
        elif self.cart[item][0] % 2 == 0:
            counter, _ = self.cart[item]
            self.cart[item] = (counter + 1, time.time())
```

**Advantages:**
- Can determine order of operations
- Can replay operations
- Better for auditing

---

**Q4.4: How to implement CLS in distributed system?**

**Answer:**
```
1. Each node maintains its own CLS
2. Periodically sync with other nodes
3. Use gossip protocol for sync
4. Handle network partitions gracefully
5. Merge states when partition heals
```

**Challenges:**
- Network delays
- Node failures
- Partition tolerance

---

**Q4.5: Relationship between CLS and CRDT**

**Answer:**
CLS is a type of CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type).

**What is CRDT?**
- Data structure that can be replicated
- Concurrent operations don't conflict
- Automatic conflict resolution

**Other CRDTs:**
- Counter CRDT
- Register CRDT
- Map CRDT
- List CRDT
